      <h1 class="nhsuk-u-margin-bottom-5">Check an isolation note</h1>
      <p>Use this service if you are an employer and want to check that a coronavirus isolation note is valid.</p>
      <p>An isolation note is proof that an employee has been told to self-isolate because of coronavirus and therefore cannot go to work.</p>
      <h2 class="nhsuk-heading-m">Before you start</h2>
      <p>To check an isolation note is valid, you need:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>the 16 digit reference number on the isolation note</li>
        <li>the employeeâ€™s date of birth</li>
      </ul>
         
      <a class="nhsuk-button" href="/check/reference-number">Start now</a>
      
      <p>By using this service you are agreeing to our <a href="https://www.nhs.uk/using-the-nhs/nhs-services/the-nhs-app/isolation-note/terms/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">terms of use</a> and <a href="https://www.nhs.uk/using-the-nhs/nhs-services/the-nhs-app/isolation-note/privacy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">privacy policy</a>.</p>
      <h2 class="nhsuk-heading-m">Information for employers on coronavirus</h2> 
      <p>User your discretion around the need for medical evidence if an employee is advised to stay at home because of coronavirus.</p>
      <p>Employees who cannot work because of coronavirus should avoid going to their GP or a hospital to request a fit note. This is to let doctors focus on their patients.</p>
      <p>If you need evidence to confirm that an employee cannot work because of coronavirus, ask them to get an isolation note.</p>
      <p>Isolation notes are for employees who cannot work because they have symptoms of coronavirus or because they live with someone who has symptoms of coronavirus.</p>
      <p><b>Working from home</b></p>
      <p>To prevent the spread of coronavirus, you should encourage your employees to work at home, wherever possible.</p>
      <p>If your employees can work from home, and are well enough to work, they do not need an isolation note.</p>
