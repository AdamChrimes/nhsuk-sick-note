      <p>Use this service if:</p>
      <p>you have to stay at home for more than 7 days because of coronavirus and:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>you need a note for your employer</li>
      </ul>
      
      <p>You do not need a note if you have to stay at home for 7 days or less. Instead your employer can ask you to confirm why you've been off. This is called self-certification.</p>
