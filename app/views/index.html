      <p>Use this service if:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>you have already been self-isolating for 7 days and need a note for your employer that you need to stay at home for longer</li>
        <li>you have agreed with your employer that you cannot work from home</li>
        </ul>
      
      <div class="nhsuk-inset-text">
        <span class="nhsuk-u-visually-hidden">Information: </span>
        <p>You can stay off work for up to 7 days without having to get a fit note or isolation note. Instead your employer can ask you to confirm that you've been ill. You can do this by filling in a form yourself when you return to work. This is called self-certification.</p>
      </div>

      <p>You can request an isolation note on behalf of someone else.</p>
