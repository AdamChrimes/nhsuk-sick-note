      <p>Use this service if you have been told to self-isolate because of coronavirus and you need a note for your employer.</p>
      <p>This service is only for people who:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>have symptoms of coronavirus</li>
        <li>live with someone who has symptoms of coronavirus</li>
      </ul>

      <p>If you have symptoms of coronavirus, the first thing you need to do is get health advice. If you have not already done this, use the <a href="https://111.nhs.uk/covid-19">111 online coronavirus service</a> (England), <a href="https://www.nhsinform.scot/self-help-guides/self-help-guide-coronavirus-covid-19">NHS inform</a> (Scotland), <a href="https://www.nhsdirect.wales.nhs.uk/SelfAssessments/symptomcheckers/COVID19.aspx">NHS Direct Wales</a> or <a href="https://www.publichealth.hscni.net/news/covid-19-coronavirus">Public Health Agency</a> (Northern Ireland).</p>
