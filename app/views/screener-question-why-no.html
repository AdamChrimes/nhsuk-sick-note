      <h1 class="nhsuk-heading-l">You do not need an isolation note</h1>
      <p>You can only get an isolation note if you have been told to self-isolate because:
        <ul>
          <li>you have symptoms of coronavirus</li>
          <li>you live with someone who has symptoms of coronavirus</li>
          <li>you are in a support bubble with someone who has symptoms of coronavirus</li>
          <li>you have been told to self-isolate by a test and trace service</li>
      </ul>
            <h2 class="nhsuk-heading-m">If you are at high risk (clinically extremely vulnerable)</h2>
     
      <p>If you are at high risk from coronavirus, the NHS should have sent you a letter advising you to stay at home. This is called shielding.</p>
      <p>You should work from home if possible. Your employer should support you to do this.</p>
      <p>If you cannot work and need proof for your employer, the letter from the NHS counts as evidence.</p>
      <p>Speak to your GP or care team if you have not been contacted by the NHS and think you should have been.</p>
      <p>For more information on working and employment if you are shielding, see:<br>
      <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/guidance-on-shielding-and-protecting-extremely-vulnerable-persons-from-covid-19/guidance-on-shielding-and-protecting-extremely-vulnerable-persons-from-covid-19">GOV.UK: Guidance on shielding and protecting people who are clinically extremely vulnerable from COVID-19</a>.</br></p>
      <h2 class="nhsuk-heading-m">If you are at moderate risk (clinically vulnerable)</h2>

      <p>If you are at moderate risk from coronavirus, you should work from home if possible. Your employer should support you to do this.</p>
      <p>If you cannot work from home and are concerned about having to go to work, talk to your employer. Employers should make sure suitable arrangements are in place so you can continue coming in to work.</p>
      <p>People at moderate risk include people who:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>are pregnant</li>
        <li>have a condition that may increase their risk from coronavirus</li>
        <li>are 70 or older</li>
      </ul>
